# TaskForge — Remaining work (derived from PLAN.md)

> **Source of truth for scope:** [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) (full product plan, history, and acceptance notes).  
> **This file:** a **backlog-only** view — items **not** fully done per §22 and follow-up notes. Update both when you ship features.  
> **Last synced:** 2026-04-11 (RBAC pass: Settings + API Access + AI Assistant Viewer guards; §16.1 app-launch poll replaced with targeted `tasklist` on Windows; §16.2 per-workflow `replay_missed` toggle + DB migration v7; workflow card UI modernization)

## How to use this doc

- Use **PLAN.md** for narrative context, file lists, and acceptance criteria per section.  
- Use **this file** to prioritize sprints; each line points back to a `PLAN.md` section (§).  
- Section headers in PLAN.md sometimes still say "INCOMPLETE" even when §22 marks the work **Done** — trust **§22 + repo** over stale headings.

---

## Phase 1 — complete ✅

| Item | PLAN § | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|
| Settings (remaining toggles) | §14.1 | **Shipped:** language, priority default, log retention, clear on startup, replay cron, sound, toast position, theme/accent, Builder JSON, license copy. |
| Server-side log purge | §14.1 | **✅ Shipped 2026-04-11:** `electron/db/log-retention.ts` — `purgeOldLogs()` runs at startup and every 24 h in `electron/main.ts`. |

---

## Phase 2 — complete ✅

| Item | PLAN § | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|
| `input_simulation` action | §15.1 | **✅ Windows shipped:** PowerShell `System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys` via UTF-8 base64 (`electron/actions/input-simulation.ts`). Non-Windows intentionally returns "not implemented" — acceptable for this build. |

---

## Phase 3 — V2 / advanced (not ✅ in §22)

| # | Task | PLAN § | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Visual graph canvas builder (pan/zoom, edges, engine follows graph) | §3.3 | **Partial:** list-order edges persisted + topological run order in engine when edges exist. **Not started:** free-form canvas / branching UI. |
| 4 | AI conversation / multi-turn polish | §10.3 | **Partial:** **"Refine last draft"** updates the same workflow via `workflows.update` (no new workflow). Further polish always possible. |
| 5 | Multiple API keys + scopes | §12.1, §12.2 | **Partial:** scoped keys + enforcement existed; **added** `workflows:write` + `POST /v1/workflows`. |
| 8 | Trigger state persistence + missed-trigger replay | §16.2 | **✅ Shipped 2026-04-11:** `trigger_state` table (migration v5). `replayMissedCronIfEnabled` respects BOTH global `replay_missed_cron` setting AND per-workflow `replay_missed` flag (migration v7). Toggle visible in each workflow card. |
| 9 | Role-based UI (Viewer vs Editor/Admin) | §11.3 | **✅ Shipped 2026-04-11:** Settings page (save AI/prefs/license all disabled + read-only banner); API Access (regen + create key disabled + banner); AI Assistant (send/create blocked). Previously: Builder, Variables, Logs, Team, Catalog. |
| 11 | Settings — remainder after backup ZIP | §14.1 | Same as Phase 1 row — now fully shipped. |
| 12 | Online license validation (full product story) | §20.9 | Partial: **last verified** timestamp on successful online check + Settings/Team display of seats / valid-until. **Hosted license API + full §20.9.6** out of repo. |

### Entitlement / commercial (§20.8 still open)

| Task | PLAN § |
|------|--------|
| Online validation — complete policy, UX, grace, revocation story | §20.9 |
| Per-seat **enforcement** (active seats / activations) | §20.8, §22 Phase 4 |
| ✅ `*tfProIf` / global license signal directive | §20.8 · **directive wired 2026-04-11** — `TfProIfDirective` now supports `else` template; used in `analytics-page` and `ai-assistant-page` to show Pro gate to free users. |
| ✅ Audit log when org key saved / cleared | §20.8 · `entitlement.saved` / `entitlement.cleared` |
| Settings: "Connected to license service / last verified …" copy | §20.7 future note · **partially addressed** via last-verified + valid-until lines |

---

## Phase 4 — future platform (§22)

(Unchanged — see prior PLAN-REMAINING / PLAN.md §22 for marketplace, cloud sync, license server, etc.)

---

## Other gaps called out in PLAN.md (worth tracking)

| Area | PLAN § | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|
| AI heuristic parser breadth + confidence | §10.4 | **Expanded keywords + confidence score + UI hint** ✅; further tuning always possible. |
| Audit log filtering (action type, date range, resource type) | §13.2 | **Date range + status + existing filters + empty state + toast export** ✅. |
| §13.1 narrative vs code | §13.1 | Plan text predates `writeAuditLog`; treat "missing IPC coverage" as **verify + extend** if any mutation lacks audit. |
| App launch trigger efficiency | §16.1 | **✅ Improved 2026-04-11:** `pollResources()` now uses targeted `tasklist /FI IMAGENAME eq <name>` on Windows (much lighter than full `si.processes()` list). `trigger_poll_interval_ms` is configurable (default 5 000 ms, min 1 000 ms). |
| Loading states across pages | §21.3 | **✅ Shipped 2026-04-11:** `loading.run()` wired on variables, team, api-access, analytics, audit-logs, marketplace, and logs pages. All pages now show the shell progress bar on first load. |
| Empty states component on list pages | §21.4 | **✅ Shipped 2026-04-11:** team page (no members / only-self states). Previously on: workflows, logs, variables, audit-logs, marketplace. |
| Logs UX | §6.1 | **✅ Shipped 2026-04-11:** sticky "↑ N new logs — click to load" nudge banner appears when `onLogsNew` fires while `<main>` is scrolled > 120 px. Clicking scrolls to top and reloads. |
